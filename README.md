### Thoughts:
This article provides a introduction to Copilot and the experience of software developers using it. It mainly covers the pros and cons of using Copilot along with programming, and the specific asepects that programmers found it helpful or annoying. It allows me to critically think about how to leverage AI efficiently in programming - I can make use of its syntax check and autocompletion to avoid being trapped in the details, but it's important that I stil have comprehensive understanding of the whole project and logic.
